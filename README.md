# DiskScheduling

In this program, we have tried to compare different disk scheduling algorithms(Random, First-in first-out(FIFO), Shortest seek time first(SSFT), SCAN, C-SCAN) in which I have taken 1000 processes in my process queue, and for each process in the process queue, I have found the response time with respect to a particular algorithm, after obtaining the data of response time I have noted minimum response time, maximum response time, average response time, the standard deviation of response time and throughput of the algorithm for the generated random input.
